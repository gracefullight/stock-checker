# QA Review Checklist

Apply checks to the changed scope and the project's declared requirements,
supported platforms, and existing architecture. Mark irrelevant checks N/A.
Measure against adopted targets; example sizes, durations, load levels, or
implementation patterns are not universal acceptance gates. Record required
checks that could not run as verification gaps, not passes or defect findings.

## Security Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Passwords hashed with Argon2id (scrypt/bcrypt acceptable; never MD5/SHA1)
- [ ] Password policy enforced when local password authentication is used
- [ ] JWT tokens properly signed and validated when JWT is used
- [ ] Refresh tokens implemented (if long sessions needed)
- [ ] Token/session expiry and rotation match the declared authentication policy
- [ ] Protected endpoints enforce the required authorization; public endpoints are intentionally public
- [ ] Resource ownership, tenant, and role boundaries match the access model
- [ ] Admin functions require admin role
- [ ] Authentication abuse controls match the declared threat model and rate-limit policy
- [ ] Account lockout after failed login attempts (optional)
- [ ] MFA available (optional, but recommended)

### Input Validation & Injection
- [ ] SQL injection: ORM used OR parameterized queries
- [ ] XSS: Input sanitized, CSP headers set
- [ ] Command injection: No shell execution with user input
- [ ] Path traversal: File paths validated
- [ ] LDAP injection: LDAP queries parameterized

## Notes

- Choose available automated checks that match the stack, changed scope, and target; do not require unrelated tools or unrequested builds
- Use configured code intelligence or the documented native fallback for code analysis patterns
- Browser verification follows `mcp.devtools_browsers`: Aside (`aside`, default), Chrome DevTools MCP (`chrome`), and Firefox DevTools MCP (`firefox`). Multiple selections are supported; change them with `oma update mcp`. Discover the selected server’s tools before use. Chrome-specific calls below are examples only; use supported equivalents for Aside and Firefox. An empty selection disables browser MCP verification; report unverified UI checks.
- Document all findings with file:line references
- Provide remediation code examples
- Estimate fix time for each issue

## Runtime Verification (after static review)

Record results in the structured table format defined in `execution-protocol.md` Step 2.5 (Recording Results).
Run only applicable, authorized runtime checks on an available target. A static
document/configuration review does not require starting or building an app.

- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] All modified endpoints return expected status codes; verify with `list_network_requests()`
- [ ] Form submissions produce correct database state; verify with `fill_form()` + `list_network_requests()`
- [ ] Error states render user-friendly messages (not stack traces); verify with `take_snapshot()` on error paths
- [ ] Empty/loading/error UI states all handled; verify with `navigate_page()` to empty state routes + `take_snapshot()`
- [ ] Interactive elements respond to input (not display-only); verify with `click(uid)` + `take_snapshot()` before/after
- [ ] Auth flows work end-to-end (register → login → protected route → logout); verify with sequential `fill()` + `click()` + `list_network_requests()`
- [ ] Rate limiting / throttling triggers at configured thresholds; verify with rapid `evaluate_script(fetch)` calls
- [ ] File upload/download actually transfers data (not stubbed); verify with `upload_file(uid, filePath)` + response check
- [ ] Pagination returns correct pages (not always page 1); verify with `click()` page 2 + `take_snapshot()` to confirm different content
- [ ] Zero JS console errors on critical paths; verify with `list_console_messages(types: ["error"])`
